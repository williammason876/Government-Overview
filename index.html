The <b>Legislative Branch</b> is made up of two chambers the House of Representatives and the Senate; The <b>Executive branch</b> is made up of the President, his cabinet, and several other independent agencies such as the FBI and CIA; while the <b>Judicial Branch</b> is made up of the federal judges appointed a variety of levels ranging from the Supreme Court all the way down to Federal District Courts.
