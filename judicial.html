		United States Supreme Court justices are appointed by the President of the United States and approved by the United States Senate. Once appointed, justices serve for a life term or until retirement. 
		The Supreme Court of the United States is located in Washington D.C.. The United States federal court system consists of 94 federal judicial districts. The 94 districts are then divided into twelve regional circuits. 
		The United States has five different types of courts that are considered subordinate to the Supreme Court: United States bankruptcy courts, United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, United States Court of International Trade, United States Courts of Appeals, and United States District Courts.
